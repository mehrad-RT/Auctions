# Auctions

## About The Project

This project is an auction website that allows users to list different types of vehicles, including **personal jets**, **motorcycles**, and **cars**, for auction. Users can place bids on listed items, and if a seller accepts a bid, the auction is closed. The website mainly focuses on backend functionalities.

## Features

- **List a Vehicle for Auction**: Users can easily add their own vehicles to the auction, creating a dedicated page for each listing.
- **Bid on Auctions**: Users can place bids on any vehicle, and if the seller accepts a bid, the auction will be closed.
- **Add Comments**: Users can add their comments to each auction listing.
- **Watchlist**: Users can add auctions to a watchlist for quick access and to keep track of favorite listings.
